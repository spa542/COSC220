Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates the pure essence of recursion. Recursion involves a function calling itself
within it's function call. Throughout this entire lab, only a bare list is used for all of the data 
being moved and passed around. Every single function that is called is recursive. This is 
everywhere from the print function all the way to the makeshift destructor 
that is manually made. This program truly shows what recursion can do. All of these functions 
created are proven and provide no memory leaks as shown.

File to pay attention to:

main.o - This is the compilataion linker file

main - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without having to input specific commands

Makefile Instructions:

To compile the program:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything together for you. Then 
proceed with using ./main in order to run the program.

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instructions above to run the program without any manual work. If not using 
Makefile, then you must compile the .cpp file into a .o file. (g++ -c main.cpp)
Then you must link that with a final compilation all the while labeling the output file as main.
**You must us -std=c++11 within your compilation steps.
