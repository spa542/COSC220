Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates the use of templates. It follows the idea that we do not want to have
to repeat code over and over to do similar functions. Therefore we create a template class
along with template functions that allow the class and functions to take any data type.
This is great because you only have to implement functionality once and this will allow any
data type that you would like to work as you choose. This is extremely useful because 
if you want lists of 2 or more data types, then you only have to type the functionality 
once. Then every data type will work as you please.

Files to pay attention to:

main.o, payroll.o - These are the compilation linker files

main - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without having to input specific commands

Makefile Instructions:

To compile the program:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything together for you. Then
proceed with using ./main in order to run the program.

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instructions above to run the program without any manual work. If not
using Makefile, then you must compile the .cpp files into .o files. (g++ -c main.cpp) Then
you must link those with a final compilation all the while labeling the output file as main.
**You must use -std=c++11 within your compilation steps
