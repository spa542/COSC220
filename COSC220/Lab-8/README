Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates algorithm analysis using time functions that are within 
c++ in order to see the elapsed time that it takes to complete quick sort. 
The elapsed time proves mathematical Big-O because quick sort follows the 
order of O(nlogn) on average. The tests that are done in this lab show how
fast this algorithm really is when looking back to the basic algorithms that
were tested in previous labs.

Files to pay attention to:

main.o - This is the compilation linker file

main - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without having to input
specific commands

Makefile Instructions:

To compile the program:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything 
together for you. Then proceed with using ./main in order to run the program.

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instructions above to run the program without any manual
work. If not using Makefile, then you must compile the .cpp file into a .o
file. (g++ -c main.cpp) Then you must link that with a final compilation all
the while labeling the output file as main.
**You must use -std=c++11 within your compilation steps
