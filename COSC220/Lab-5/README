Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates the use of stacks backed by a linked list. Basic stack algorithms are 
implemented such as push() and pop(). This lab also demonstrates the big three. These would be a 
destructor, copy constructor, and overloaded assignment. If you need one then you need all of them. 
This program demonstrates the use of all three. Overall, these functions as well as a size() 
function will allow a basic implementation of a stack using dynamic memory.

Files to pay attention to:

main.o, payroll.o, PayRollStack.o - These are the three linker files that are needed for compilation

main - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without haveing to input specific commands

MakeFile Instructions:

To compile the program:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything together for you
Then proceed with using ./main in order to the run the program

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instruction above to run the program without any manual work. If not using 
Makefile, then you much compile all three .cpp files together into .o files. Then you must link them and compile all while labeling the output file as main. **You must use -std=c++11 within your compilation steps.
