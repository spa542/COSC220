Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates the use of inheritance and polymorphism. It follows the idea that separate classes have a 
"is a" relationship and Executives and Hourly Workers are Employees and that is how the inheritance works. The 
child classes have access to the parent classes private members as well as adding their own specific members and
functions themselves. The polymorphism aspect is shown by using virtual functions and overriding the parent 
functions in the child class in order to create its own special function while following the same logic or goal
as the original parent function.

Files to pay attention to:

main.o, Employee.o, Executive.o, Hourly.o - These are the compilation linker files

main - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without having to input specific commands

Makefile Instructions:

To compile the program:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything together for you. Then proceed
with using ./main in order to run the program.

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instructions above to run the program without any manual work. If not using Makfile, 
then you must compile the .cpp files into .o files. (g++ -c main.cpp) Then you must link those with a final
compilation all the while labeling the output file as main.
**You must use -std=c++11 within your compilation steps
