Lab Description:
This lab demonstrates extensive work on the concept of polymorphism. This lab is the basics of an old school
rpg based game like oregon trail and that of the such. It is run using a game loop that has a pointer to a parent
class and all of the "states" of the game are then inheriting that of the main gamestate. The pointer in the main
function demonstrates polymorphism because it allows for the program gamestate pointer to access anything from any
other class that inherits from gamestate. Therefore, showing how c++ polymorphism works in a nutshell.

Files to pay attention to:

main.o, monster.o, player.o, travelstate.o, combatstate.o, idlestate.o - These are the compilation linker files

main - Output file that is run when the program is executed by the user

Makefile - File that allows the user to compile without having to input specific commands

Makefile Instructions:

To compile the program:
Type "make" without the quotes and the program will compile everything together for you. Then proceed with useing ./main
in order to run the program.

Instructions for Program:

Follow the Makefile instructions above to run the program without any manual work. If not using Makefile, 
then you must compile the .cpp files into .o files. (g++ -c mian.cpp) Then you must link those with a final
compilation all the while labeling the output file as main.
**You must use -std=c++11 within your compilation steps
