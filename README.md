## Course Overview:
A study of the design and implementation of abstract data types and algorithms
using an object-oriented approach and standard class library. Attention will be paid to the
introduction of data structures such as linked lists, vectors, stacks, queues, priority queues, lists,
trees, etc.; searching and sorting algorithms and their runtime analysis. C++ is the teaching
language.
<br /> <br />
## Primary Language Used:
* C++
<br /> <br />
## Other Important Libraries/Applications Used:
* Debian based linux environment
* C++ standard library

## Major Projects:
### Project 1 Student Database:
#### Author: Ryan Rosiak
#### Description:
This project demonstrates the use of a linked list of linked lists. The main linked list represents a the database of students containing each containing a linked list of 
courses that are attached to the student. The database has full CRUD functionality.
### Project 2 Towers of Hanoi:
#### Author: Ryan Rosiak
#### Description:
This project is the Tower's of Hanoi game implemented using a stack. Basic stack functions are present.
### Project 3 Data Structure Library:
#### Authors: Ryan Rosiak and Grant Dawson
#### Description:
This project is a re-implementation of a the list, stack, and queue library from the C++ standard library.
